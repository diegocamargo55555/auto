unless condition
  #thing to be done if the condition is false
end

=begin
It is basically the reverse of the if statement, because if statements will only be done if the condition is true, but the unless statement will only be done if the condition is false. The else keyword can also be used inside unless statements.
=end


while condition
    #something to do
end




#until statements are the opposite of while statements; they repeat until a condition becomes true. Here is their syntax:

until condition
    #something to do
end
